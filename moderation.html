			<h2>Moderation Rules Overview</h2>
			<p>As a publisher's popularity increases, the volume of comments increases, which is great! However, with higher overall comment volume comes more spam and other comments that don't contribute to the conversation. For many large publishers, moderation at scale can become a huge burden that obfuscates the value of comments. Some publishers spend hours moderating hundreds or thousands of comments a day. In an effort to reduce this cost and resurface the value of comments, my team designed a tool called Moderation Rules to give moderators access to more robust options while maintaining the moderation preferences of each unique publisher. For this series of projects, I was the lead product designer responsible for the end-to-end product from user research and interaction design to visual design.</p>
			<p><emphasis>Note: The term 'publisher' and 'moderator' are often synonymous for smaller sites. In larger sites, a publisher is often the overarching entity that may have a moderation team that manages Disqus comments.</p>
			<p><strong>Problem:</strong> As a publisher grows, they can become overwhelmed by the large number of comments that require moderation, especially comments that don't contribute to the conversation. The burden of spending time moderating comments can often obfuscate the value of comments.</p>
			<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Through a series of iterative research and ideation phases, we designed a tool called Moderation Rules that allows moderators to assign automatic actions to comments with a defined set of characteristics.</p>
			<h2>Team Alignment</h2>
			<p>I start out every project by getting alignment with the team around what we know, what our assumptions are, and what we want to achieve. This usually takes the form of whiteboarding and/or sticky-noting exercises. We built empathy for our users by exploring user stories and problem areas concerning moderation from each of their perspectives.</p>

			<p>Some of our major assumptions coming out of these sessions were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Discovery interviews with moderators</h2>
			<p>To address these assumptions... We interviewed some Disqus moderators... We also showed them some sketches of solution ideas we had. Taking the user stories and problems we generated from these exercises, I sketched out different concepts including: <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2804915-shadow-banning" target="_blank">shadow banning</a>, <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2806737-timeouts" target="_blank">timeouts</a>, <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1450364-comment-policy" target="_blank">and comment policy</a>. I created a narrative and presented these concepts to moderators to see what resonated and survey their likeliness to use each feature. One of these early-stage concepts included an algorithm that learns the moderation preferences of a publisher and provides suggested actions based on previous moderation history. Moderators would also have the option to automatically accept these suggested actions via an "automoderation" setting. This concept was well-received by moderators and they unanimously agreed that this would be amazing <em>if&nbsp</em> it could truly work as designed. See the video below for a clip from one of the user interviews where I sought feedback on the "Suggested Actions" paper prototype. <em>Note: There's audio.</em></p>

			<h2>Tech constraints, 3rd parties, and usability testing</h2>
			<p>After validating Suggested and Automated Actions as a concept, we were eager to start building. Unfortunately, due to technical constraints, we weren't able to build the machine learning system that would provide Suggested Actions based off a unique publisher's moderation preferences. We decided to start by suggesting network-wide rules while we continued to investigate custom moderation settings per publisher. In our research, we discovered a number of potential 3rd party partnerships that could help us better categorize comments. After coordinating several calls with various organizations, we decided to partner with Google's Perspective team to use machine learning to identify toxic comments and build our first Suggested Action: Delete if Toxic. Taking all of this new information into account, I built a high-fidelity prototype of Suggested and Automated Actions and tested its usability with moderators.</p>

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>We've since created an MVP version of Suggested Actions and are looking to gather data that can answer a few of our questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do moderators understand what Suggested Actions are?</li>
				<li>Do moderators agree with our actions more often when we show a Suggested Action?</li>
				<li>Do moderators like Suggested Actions enough to select multiple (or all) comments at once and bulk Accept Suggested Actions?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To answer the questions above, Suggested Actions is currently in beta with a cohort of some of our most active moderators. Additionally, I conducted a design review with our engineers as well as other product team members and they provided some great design feedback. Since I've made some changes to the design based on my team's feedback and that of the moderators from the usability study, I'll be conducting another usability study with moderators to make sure the new design is still easy to understand and use. We'll also be showing these moderators a low-fidelity concept of Automated Actions to start gaining more confidence on this concept and to continue working toward our goal of reducing (maybe even eliminating!) the cost of moderation and resurfacing the value of comments.</p>
