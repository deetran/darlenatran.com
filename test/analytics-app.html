			<h2>Analytics App Project Overview</h2>
			<p>This app was built for pricing analysts who needed to check information about their prices while they were away from their desktop. It was designed specifically for the tablet because our research showed that a phone design would provide little to no value due to the lack of screen real estate. I was mainly a UI designer throughout this project, but I was responsible for almost all UX requests after the initial wireframing phase.</p>
			<h2>Sketching</h2>
			<p>Our team normally starts with user research, but due to an aggressive timeline, myself and two other designers brainstormed with the product manager while our UX researcher helped us plan our initial round of testing. To get the project up to speed, our team spent several days with the product manager to get some ideas flowing and to help shape some business requirements.</p>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>Our UX researcher conducted interviews with potential users to assess the need and value for the product we intended to design. We received initial market validation and learned a lot more about our target users. The user feedback helped us quickly discover that users preferred a tablet to a phone application due to screen size. The lack of real estate on phones rendered the application useless due to the level of detail that they needed.</p>
			<h2>Wireframing</h2>
			<p>Our initial round of research gave us greater insight into understand our users and their needs. With that ammunition, we were able to validate some of our assumptions. We were also able to quickly throw out our sketches of the phone workflows.

			<h2>More Research!</h2>
			<p>We built a high-fidelity prototype that worked on a tablet and went on a customer on-site visit to get feedback from 12 users. We walked them through our feedback and wanted to know what they thought of the overall concept, if they would use it, and look for future improvements. We were also able to test the usability of certain parts of the design such as success with touch targets. I was personally responsible for walking through 4 of the participants through the prototype and noting their feedback.</p>
			<h2>High-fidelity designs</h2>
			<p>By this point, we had received significant positive feedback through multiple rounds of user testing and proceeded with completing all the high-fidelity design deliverables for development. I designed over 40 screens and provided extensive documentation detailing gesture interactions. It was important to detail every interaction that could possibly exist on each screen to ensure proper feedback, especially for mobile devices. To avoid static, abrupt transitions. Animation is important because motion can help draw relationships of components and help the user's conceptual model of what is related to what. A lot of inspiration was taken from the principles of <a href"https://material.google.com/">Material Design</a> A lot of work was done side-by-side with developers to explain the documentation and work together to get them just right. After the designs were complete, I worked closely with the developers to explain any gaps in interaction design and also daily standups, sprint demos, and retrospectives with the developers to ensure that what was developed was what was envisioned by the UX team. Below is an example of some of that documentation and a video animation to show the flow of the app in action.</p>
