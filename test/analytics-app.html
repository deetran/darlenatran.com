			<h2>Analytics App Project Overview</h2>
			<p>This app was built for pricing analysts who needed to check information about their prices while they were away from their desktop. It was designed specifically for the tablet because our research showed that a phone design would provide little to no value due to the lack of screen real estate. I was mainly a UI designer throughout this project, but I was responsible for handling all UX requests after the initial wireframing phase.</p>
			<h2>Sketching</h2>
			<p>Our team normally starts with user research, but due to an aggressive timeline, myself and two other designers brainstormed with the product manager while our UX researcher helped us plan our initial round of testing. To get the project up to speed, our team spent several days with the product manager to get some ideas flowing and to help shape some business requirements.</p>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>Our UX researcher conducted interviews with potential users to assess the need and value for the product we intended to design. We received initial market validation and learned a lot more about our target users. The user feedback helped us quickly discover that users preferred a tablet to a phone application due to screen size. The lack of real estate on phones rendered the application useless due to the level of detail that they needed. This research discovery saved the team countless hours of designing for a case that users would never need.</p>
			<h2>Wireframing</h2>
			<p>Our first round of research gave us greater insight into understanding our users and their needs. We converted our initial assumptions into validated facts about our users' wants, needs, and personas. With that information in mind, we proceeded to wireframe and layout the information architecture of the app and iterate with research to hone the product.

			<h2>More Research!</h2>
			<p>My team and I built a high-fidelity prototype on a tablet and scheduled an on-site visit to get feedback from 12 potential users. My two teammates and myself divided the users into 3 groups, so I was personally responsible for moderating a prototype walkthrough for 4 of the 12 participants. I walked them through our prototype and gathered their thoughts on the overall concept, whether it provided enough value to fit into their daily workflow, and suggestions for improvement. We were also able to test the usability of certain aspects of the design such as success rates with touch targets and gesture interactions.</p>
			<h2>High-fidelity designs</h2>
			<p>By this point, we had received significant positive feedback through multiple rounds of user testing and proceeded with completing all the high-fidelity design deliverables for development. I designed over 40 screens and provided extensive documentation detailing gesture interactions. It was important to detail every interaction that could possibly exist on each screen to ensure proper feedback, especially for mobile devices. This attention to detail allows for a smooth, seamless experience as opposed to a static, haphazard one. A lot of inspiration was taken from the principles of <a href"https://material.google.com/">Material Design</a> I spent a lot of time side-by-side with developers to explain the documented interactions and worked closely with them to get them just right. After the designs were complete, I worked closely with the developers to explain any gaps in interaction design and also daily standups, sprint demos, and participate in retrospectives with the developers to ensure that what was developed was what was envisioned by the UX team. Below is an example of some of that documentation and a video animation to show the flow of the app in action.</p>
