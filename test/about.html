				<h2>Hi, I'm Darlena!</h2>
				<p>I'm a designer with both visual and interaction design skills. Visual designers very much own the "look and feel" of a product, which I believe is an important aspect to product design as well. Interaction designers own the flow of the product. I don't believe that one is better without the other. The marriage of the two disciplines is what I believe results in a truly great end-to-end product. 
				</p>
				<p>That being said, I'm looking for a role that is more focused on interaction design. While I appreciate and am capable of visual design, time flies when I'm working with the nuances and intracacies of a problem. I want to understand the ins-and-outs to find the right solution. I enjoy working in the constraints of time and development resources. I'm a problem solver that enjoys working in a constrained environment. Figuring out where to push my design boundaries and where energy towards a battle is better fought elsewhere.

				<h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
				<p>My goal as a designer is twofold: I want to save people time and allow them to spend that spare time on the things that they truly enjoy. I believe the power to innovate is innately human. Taking inspiration
