			<h2>Forecaster Project Overview</h2>
			<p>Forecaster is a product made for pricing analysts. It provides pricing recommendations and also allows the analyst to provide manual input when needed. Ideally, the most optimal software would price everything correctly according to supply and demand. However, the software requires some human intervention because the algorithm behind the recommendations always needs subjective tweaking for events like holiday specials. While reviewing these screens, please keep in mind that the users of this application are power users that are used to consuming large amounts of data and utilizing certain vocabulary and definitions that are niche to their industry.</p>
			<p>Problem: The current application design was disparated and bloated with one-off features. The result was a convoluted, disjointed design that had all the functionality the user needed, but in a disjointed workflow.</p>
			<p>Solution: Re-assessed the need for each feature... Removed some, combined others, and added some as made sense to the persona we had. Merged two screens that 'spoke to each other' to make more sense.</p>
			<h2>Getting the Team Together</h2>
			<p>Mini design sprint info here. Storyboarding, etc. The part I loved was working with so many different roles. Learning about the user through the product manager because he was a former user, or working with the developer on understanding and tidying up the algorithm behind the recommendations/science.</p>
