			<h2>Forecaster Project Overview</h2>
			<p>Forecaster is a product made for pricing analysts. It provides pricing recommendations and also allows the analyst to provide manual input when needed. Ideally, the most optimal software would price everything correctly according to supply and demand. However, the software requires some human intervention because the algorithm behind the recommendations always needs subjective tweaking for events like holiday specials. For this project, I was the sole UX and UI designer.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> While reviewing these screens, please keep in mind that the users of this application are power users that are used to consuming large amounts of data and utilizing certain vocabulary and definitions that are niche to their industry.</p>
			<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The old application design was bloated with one-off features added over the past year. The result was a convoluted, disconnected design that had all the functionality the user needed, but in a disjointed workflow.</p>
			<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I brought the product managers, developers, and science team members together and organized a mini design sprint to redesign the core features in the application. Together, we re-assessed the need for each feature. We removed some, combined others, and added a couple features as it made sense for our persona.</p>
			<h2>Getting the Team Together</h2>
			<p>I spent the first several days with the product manager (a subject matter expert with former experience with the application) just to understand the daily workflow for our user persona. I then launched the design initiative by bringing the Forecaster team together with the intent of getting us all on the same page with the problem at hand. Together we came up with facts vs. assumptions, doodled storyboards, sketched our ideas, and had long, meaningful discussions about the design. We even dived into rigorous conversations with the team behind the algorithm that provided the recommendations to better understand the back-end.</p>

			<h2>High-fidelity design</h2>
			<p>After many sketching sessions, the team was able to agree on a design that we all felt was more usable and cleaner to implement technically than the old design. So far, we have received highly positive reviews from informal feedback sessions with our users. Just recently, we received the approval to conduct usability testing and look forward to that in the next couple months. I'm concerned about the click-target sizes, so I'm excited that we get the opportunity to test that aspect as well as the overall intuitiveness of the design. Please see the video below for a demo of the application.</p>
